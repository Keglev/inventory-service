# Security API Index

This is a placeholder index for security-related API endpoints and documentation.

- **Authentication**: See `docs/api/endpoints/authentication.md` for OAuth2 flows.
- **Sessions**: Session management and cookie policies.
- **Tokens**: Token lifecycle, refresh and revocation.

(Placeholder created so `docs/api-overview.md` links resolve. Replace with the canonical security API index content.)
