# Test Execution Reports

This folder will contain generated test execution reports (Surefire/Failsafe). CI copies JaCoCo and test reports into `docs/backend/coverage` and this location is a placeholder to reference those artifacts from architecture documentation.

If you need a local example, place HTML reports here under `index.html` or subfolders named per module.
