# API Documentation

Welcome to the API documentation hub for SmartSupplyPro. This directory contains narrative guides, endpoint overviews, and references to the canonical OpenAPI specification located under `openapi/`.

- Guides: `./guides/` — how to use the API, authentication, errors, versioning, testing, and conventions.
- Endpoints: `./endpoints/` — light index pages per tag that link into the ReDoc documentation.
- OpenAPI: `./openapi/openapi-root.yaml` — canonical API specification (source of truth).
- Interactive: `./redoc/index.html` — ReDoc-rendered interactive documentation.

See `guides/overview.md` for a quick start.
