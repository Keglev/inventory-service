# Architecture API Index

This is a placeholder page linking architecture guidance to API-level concerns.

- **Architecture patterns**: See `docs/architecture/` for design patterns.
- **Integration**: Links to integration patterns and mapper guidelines.
- **OpenAPI components**: Guidance on DTOs and schema evolution.

(Placeholder created so `docs/api-overview.md` links resolve. Replace with full architecture API index content.)
