# Step 2: Review & Update Backend Comments

**Goal**: Ensure all backend Java code has proper, enterprise-level documentation

**Status**: üîÑ READY TO START  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Priority**: High (code quality & maintainability)

---

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Scan all Java files** for missing or outdated comments
2. **Review JavaDoc quality** (not generating HTML, but maintaining standards)
3. **Document test files** with clear test case descriptions
4. **Add inline comments** for complex business logic
5. **Document public APIs** with examples and parameter descriptions
6. **Ensure consistency** across all packages

## üîç What to Look For

### Class-Level Documentation
```java
/**
 * Service implementation for inventory item operations.
 * 
 * <p>This service handles CRUD operations, stock adjustments, and price changes
 * for inventory items. It enforces business rules and validation before
 * persisting changes to the database.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Key responsibilities:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Inventory item lifecycle management</li>
 *   <li>Stock quantity tracking and validation</li>
 *   <li>Price change history recording</li>
 *   <li>Supplier-based access control</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @author Smart Supply Pro Team
 * @since 1.0
 * @see InventoryItem
 * @see InventoryItemValidator
 */
public class InventoryItemServiceImpl implements InventoryItemService {
```

### Method-Level Documentation
```java
/**
 * Adjusts the quantity of an inventory item.
 * 
 * <p>This method validates the adjustment reason, ensures the resulting quantity
 * is non-negative, and records the change in stock history for audit purposes.</p>
 * 
 * @param itemId the ID of the inventory item to adjust
 * @param quantityChange the change amount (positive for additions, negative for reductions)
 * @param reason the reason for the adjustment (e.g., RESTOCK, SALE, DAMAGED)
 * @param userId the ID of the user making the adjustment
 * @return the updated inventory item with new quantity
 * @throws ResourceNotFoundException if the item doesn't exist
 * @throws InvalidRequestException if the adjustment would result in negative quantity
 * @throws UnauthorizedException if the user doesn't have access to this supplier's items
 */
public InventoryItem adjustQuantity(Long itemId, Integer quantityChange, 
                                     StockChangeReason reason, Long userId) {
```

### Inline Comments for Complex Logic
```java
// Check if user has permission to modify items from this supplier
// ADMIN role has access to all suppliers, USER role only their own
if (!hasSupplierAccess(userId, item.getSupplierId())) {
    throw new UnauthorizedException("No access to items from this supplier");
}

// Calculate new quantity and ensure it doesn't go negative
Integer newQuantity = item.getQuantity() + quantityChange;
if (newQuantity < 0) {
    throw new InvalidRequestException(
        "Quantity cannot be negative. Current: " + item.getQuantity() 
        + ", Change: " + quantityChange
    );
}
```

### Test Documentation
```java
/**
 * Test: Adjusting quantity with RESTOCK reason should increase stock
 * and create a corresponding stock history entry.
 * 
 * Given: An inventory item with quantity 100
 * When: Quantity is adjusted by +50 with reason RESTOCK
 * Then: Item quantity becomes 150 AND stock history entry is created
 */
@Test
void adjustQuantity_withRestockReason_shouldIncreaseStockAndRecordHistory() {
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

### Phase 1: Assessment (15 minutes)
1. List all Java files in `src/main/java`
2. Identify files with missing class-level JavaDoc
3. Identify methods with missing documentation
4. Prioritize by package (start with low-coverage areas)

### Phase 2: Service Layer (30 minutes)
Focus on `service` and `service.impl` packages:
- Document service interfaces
- Add JavaDoc to implementation methods
- Explain business logic with inline comments
- Document exceptions thrown

### Phase 3: Security & Config (20 minutes)
Focus on `security` and `config` packages:
- Document OAuth2 configuration
- Explain security filters and handlers
- Document bean configurations
- Add examples for configuration properties

### Phase 4: Controllers & Validation (15 minutes)
- Ensure controllers reference OpenAPI docs
- Document validation rules and business constraints
- Explain custom validators

### Phase 5: Tests (20 minutes)
- Add descriptive test method names
- Document test scenarios in comments
- Explain complex test setup

## üöÄ Ready to Start?

We can approach this in two ways:

**Option A: Automated Scan**
- I'll scan all Java files and identify gaps
- Generate a report of missing documentation
- Prioritize by package

**Option B: Manual Package-by-Package**
- Start with lowest coverage package (service - 14%)
- Review each class systematically
- Update as we go

**Which approach would you prefer?**

**Previous Step**: ‚úÖ Step 1 - Backend Test Coverage Reports (COMPLETE)  
**Current Step**: üîÑ Step 2 - Review Backend Comments (READY)  
**Next Step**: ‚è≥ Step 3 - Generate Backend Docs (PENDING)
