# Step 1 Completion Checklist - Backend Test Coverage Reports

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Local Setup
- [x] Created `docs/backend/coverage/` directory
- [x] Copied JaCoCo reports from `target/site/jacoco/`
- [x] Created `docs/backend/coverage/README.md` documentation
- [x] Verified reports accessible at `docs/backend/coverage/index.html`

### CI/CD Automation
- [x] Updated `.github/workflows/ci-build.yml`:
  - [x] Added step to create coverage directory
  - [x] Added step to copy JaCoCo reports
  - [x] Added step to commit reports with `[skip ci]` tag
  - [x] Added step to push changes to GitHub
- [x] Updated `.dockerignore` to exclude `docs/` from Docker builds
- [x] Tested CI pipeline (commit e814803)

### Documentation
- [x] Added "Testing & Code Quality" section to README.md
- [x] Added live coverage link to README.md
- [x] Created comprehensive `docs/backend/coverage/README.md`
- [x] Added documentation plan to `docs/DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md`

### Git & Deployment
- [x] Committed all changes (135 files, 8045 insertions)
- [x] Pushed to GitHub (main branch)
- [x] Triggered CI build

## ‚è≥ Pending Tasks

### GitHub Pages Verification
- [ ] Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
  - Go to: Settings ‚Üí Pages
  - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
  - Branch: `main` ‚Üí `/docs`
- [ ] Wait for GitHub Pages build to complete (~1-2 minutes)
- [ ] Test coverage URL: https://keglev.github.io/inventory-service/backend/coverage/index.html
- [ ] Verify all pages load correctly (index, packages, classes)

### Next CI Build
- [ ] Wait for next CI build to complete
- [ ] Verify coverage reports are auto-copied
- [ ] Verify coverage reports are auto-committed
- [ ] Check for "[skip ci]" in commit message
- [ ] Confirm no recursive builds triggered

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Step 1 is complete when:**
1. ‚úÖ Coverage reports exist in `docs/backend/coverage/`
2. ‚úÖ CI pipeline auto-copies reports on every build
3. ‚úÖ CI pipeline auto-commits reports (with `[skip ci]`)
4. ‚è≥ GitHub Pages serves reports at public URL
5. ‚úÖ README.md links to live coverage reports
6. ‚úÖ Docker builds exclude `docs/` directory

## üìä Current Coverage Statistics

Run `mvn clean verify` to see latest coverage:
- **Overall Coverage**: View at `docs/backend/coverage/index.html`
- **Package Coverage**: Navigate through package hierarchy
- **Class Coverage**: Drill down to individual classes

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once GitHub Pages verification is complete, proceed to:

**Step 2: Review Backend Comments**
- Scan all backend Java files for missing/outdated comments
- Review test files for documentation
- Update JavaDoc comments where needed
- Ensure enterprise-level code documentation

See `docs/DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md` for full roadmap.
