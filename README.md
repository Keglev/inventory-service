## üß™ Testing & Code Quality

### Backend Test Coverage
- **JUnit 5** with Mockito for unit tests
- **Testcontainers** for integration tests
- **JaCoCo** for code coverage analysis

üìä **View Live Coverage Reports:**
üëâ [**Backend Test Coverage (JaCoCo)**](https://keglev.github.io/inventory-service/backend/coverage/index.html)

> Coverage reports are automatically updated on every CI build and published via GitHub Pages.

### Frontend Testing (Planned)
- Vitest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Coverage reports coming soon

---

## üß∞ Tech Stack

### Backend
- Java 17+, Spring Boot 3.5+
- Spring Security (OAuth2 + Role-based Access)
- Oracle Autonomous DB (Free Tier)
- REST APIs documented via OpenAPI YAML
- Docker, JUnit, Mockito

### Frontend (WIP)
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS, Axios, Chart.js
- React Router, React Testing Library, Jest

### DevOps
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Docker Compose
- Vercel (Frontend) / Fly.io or Oracle Cloud (Backend)

---

## üåê Environment Profiles

- `application-dev.yml` ‚Äî for local testing (auto-reload, detailed logs)
- `application-prod.yml` ‚Äî used in Docker + CI/CD
- `application-test.yml` ‚Äî used in unit + integration test containers

Oracle Wallet authentication is used in all environments via environment variables for secure DB access.

---

## ‚úÖ CI/CD

GitHub Actions automatically:
- Builds and tests the backend using Maven
- Runs unit + integration tests with Testcontainers
- Builds Docker image and optionally pushes to DockerHub

> Frontend CI/CD is planned after backend is fully stabilized.

---
## üîå Oracle Wallet Connectivity Test

This project includes a standalone Java utility to manually test the Oracle Wallet connection **outside Spring Boot**. This is helpful for validating database access and credentials securely.

### Prerequisites

1. Java and Oracle JDBC Driver in `/lib`
2. Oracle Wallet files downloaded and placed locally
3. `.env` file with the following keys:
   ```env
   ENABLE_WALLET_TEST=true
   TNS_ADMIN=/path/to/wallet
   ORACLE_WALLET_PASSWORD=your_wallet_password
   DB_URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@your-db
   DB_USERNAME=your_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- Modular domain-driven design (separate DTO, validation, service, repository layers)
- Full test coverage planned (unit, integration, and MockMvc)
- Designed for microservices: decoupled backend, frontend, and deployment

---

## üöÄ Deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Backend CI**: Automatic build, test, and Docker image push on backend file changes
- **Frontend CI**: Automatic build, test, and deployment to Koyeb on frontend file changes
- **Manual Production Deploy**: Due to Oracle free tier IP restrictions, backend deployment requires manual execution from local machine

### Production Deployment Workflow

1. **Push backend changes** ‚Üí Triggers CI build ‚Üí Docker image built and pushed
2. **Manual deployment** from local machine (required for Oracle IP whitelist):
   
   ```bash
   # Traditional approach - builds and deploys directly
   fly deploy
   ```
   
   This method:
   - ‚úÖ Builds image locally using your whitelisted IP
   - ‚úÖ No need to update Oracle IP whitelist frequently
   - ‚úÖ Same reliable process as before
   - ‚úÖ No dependency on external Docker images

3. **Verify deployment**:
   - Backend: https://inventoryservice.fly.dev
   - Frontend: https://inventory-service.koyeb.app

### Why This Approach Works Best
- **Oracle free tier** requires IP whitelisting, but your IP changes frequently
- **Local build** uses your current IP during Docker build process
- **Fly.io deploys** the locally built image without needing external image pulls
- **No daily IP updates** required in Oracle Cloud Console

### Environment Variables
- **Production**: Uses `application-prod.yml` profile
- **Oracle Database**: Requires IP whitelisting, handled during local build
- **Secrets**: Managed via GitHub Secrets and Fly.io secrets

---

## üëÄ Coming Next
- Frontend React dashboard
- Jenkins-based parallel CI pipeline (optional)
- Dynamic chart filtering + analytics export
