📚 **Complete Testing Documentation:**
👉 [**Testing Architecture Documentation**](./docs/architecture/testing/README.md) - Enterprise testing strategy and implementation guides

> Coverage reports are automatically updated on every CI build and published via GitHub Pages.

### 🚧 Frontend Testing (Still under construction)
- Vitest for unit testing framework
- React Testing Library for component testing  
- TypeDoc for documentation generation
- Coverage reports and documentation coming soon

<a id="tech-stack"></a>
## 🧰 Tech Stack 

### Backend
- **Java 17+** with **Spring Boot 3.5+**
- **Spring Security** (OAuth2 + Role-based Access Control)
- **Oracle Autonomous Database** (Free Tier with wallet connectivity)
- **REST APIs** documented via OpenAPI YAML specifications
- **Docker** containerization with multi-stage builds
- **JUnit 5** + **Mockito**  for comprehensive testing

### Frontend
- **React 19** + **TypeScript** for type-safe development
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for enterprise-grade component library
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Axios** for HTTP client with React Query for state management
- **React Router** for SPA navigation
- **Vitest** + **React Testing Library** for testing
- **TypeDoc** for documentation generation

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD pipelines
- **Docker Compose** for local development environment
- Fly.io for backend deployment with Oracle DB connectivity
- Koyeb for frontend deployment with automated builds
- **JaCoCo** + **GitHub Pages** for live test coverage reporting

---

<a id="environment-profiles"></a>
## 🌐 Environment Profiles

- `application-dev.yml` — Local development (auto-reload, detailed logging)
- `application-prod.yml` — Production deployment (Docker + CI/CD)  
- `application-test.yml` — Testing environment (unit + integration tests with Testcontainers)

Oracle Wallet authentication is configured via environment variables for secure database access across all environments.

---

## ✅ CI/CD

**🚧 Still under construction** - CI/CD is working, documentation updates needed

### 🔄 Automated Pipelines
GitHub Actions automatically handle:

**Backend CI/CD:**
- ✅ Builds and tests Spring Boot application using Maven
- ✅ Runs comprehensive test suite (unit tests)
- ✅ Generates and publishes test coverage reports to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Builds Docker image and pushes to DockerHub with security scanning
- ✅ Automated deployment ready (manual trigger for Oracle IP restrictions)

**Frontend CI/CD:**
- ✅ Builds and tests React application with Vitest
- ✅ Automatically deploys to Koyeb on successful builds
- ✅ Live deployment at: https://inventory-service.koyeb.app
- ✅ Health checks and smoke tests included

<a id="available-scripts"></a>
## Available Scripts

Below are a few common commands used during development:

- Backend (Maven): `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
- Run tests: `./mvnw test`
- Frontend (development): `npm run dev` (from `frontend/`)
- Frontend (build): `npm run build` (from `frontend/`)

---

## Deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline Status
**✅ CI/CD pipelines are working and operational**

**Backend Deployment:**
1. **Automated CI/CD**: Push to main → Triggers build, test, and Docker image creation
2. **Manual Production Deploy**: Due to Oracle free tier IP restrictions, backend deployment uses manual trigger:
   ```bash
   fly deploy
   ```
   This approach:
   - ✅ Uses your whitelisted IP during local Docker build process
   - ✅ Deploys via `fly.toml` configuration with `Dockerfile` and `start.sh` 
   - ✅ No dependency on external Docker registry pulls
   - ✅ Reliable deployment to: https://inventoryservice.fly.dev

**Frontend Deployment:**
- ✅ **Fully Automated**: Push to main → Auto-build and deploy to Koyeb
- ✅ **Live Application**: https://inventory-service.koyeb.app
- ✅ **Health Checks**: Automated smoke tests and health monitoring

### Why This Deployment Strategy Works
- **Oracle Free Tier**: Requires IP whitelisting for database connections
- **Fixed IP Solution**: Using Fly.io VM provides stable IP address
- **Local Build**: Ensures build process uses your whitelisted IP
- **No Daily IP Updates**: Eliminates need to constantly update Oracle IP whitelist

### Production Environment
- **Backend**: Spring Boot with `application-prod.yml` profile
- **Database**: Oracle Autonomous DB with wallet-based authentication
- **Security**: OAuth2 with Google integration
- **Monitoring**: Health check endpoints and application logging
