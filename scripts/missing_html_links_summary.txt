Summary of missing HTML links (generated from scripts/missing_html_links_report.txt)

Files scanned: docs/api/redoc

Total reported entries: 57

Grouped by source file:

- docs/api/redoc/api.html: 21 entries
  - Likely empty/dynamic href/src placeholders: 21

- docs/api/redoc/index.html: 36 entries
  - Likely empty/dynamic href/src placeholders: 36

Notes:
- All 57 entries are empty Target values (href/src empty). These are common in JS-generated ReDoc HTML where dynamic attributes are injected at runtime. Manual verification in a browser is recommended before fixing.
- Recommended action: keep these excluded from static checks by running the checker with default options (it now ignores empty targets) or re-run with `-ReportEmpty` if you want to capture them.
