Missing links / site-path issues report
Generated: 2025-10-14

Purpose
-------
This file lists documentation files that contain links likely to break when the repository is published to GitHub Pages from the `docs/` folder.

Problem pattern
---------------
- Links that begin with `/docs/...` should instead be site-root paths without the `/docs` prefix (for example `/docs/architecture/...` -> `/architecture/...`) because GitHub Pages serves the contents of the `docs/` folder at the site root.
- Some files use relative `../` or `./` which may be OK, but those should be validated per-file.

Summary of matches (top-level)
------------------------------
Files with `/docs/` absolute prefixes (should likely drop the `/docs` prefix):
- docs/architecture/README.md
- docs/architecture/patterns/README.md
- docs/architecture/patterns/controller-patterns.md
- docs/architecture/patterns/security-patterns.md
- docs/architecture/services/README.md
- docs/api/README.md
- docs/backend/README.md
- docs/backend/coverage/README.md
- docs/architecture/testing/README.md
- docs/architecture/security/README.md

Files using relative patterns that should be spot-checked (examples):
- docs/README.md (uses ../README.md anchors)
- docs/scripts/md2html.mjs (generates nav with ../index.html)
- docs/index.html (redirect/fallback link to ./api/redoc/index.html)

Notes and recommended next steps
-------------------------------
1) For files under `docs/`, replace occurrences of `/docs/` with `/` so links point to the site root paths. Example: `/docs/architecture/...` -> `/architecture/...`.
2) Validate `../` relative links in files inside `docs/` (some are correct; some may point outside `docs/` unexpectedly).
3) Update any generated HTML (JaCoCo / Javadoc) under `docs/backend/coverage/` to use site-root paths for links in breadcrumbs if necessary (this is lower priority but improves UX).
4) Run `scripts/check_links.ps1` after making replacements and iterate until the report is empty.

If you'd like, I can apply the bulk replacement for `/docs/` -> `/` across files under `docs/` and open a PR, or I can update files one-by-one so you can review each change.
