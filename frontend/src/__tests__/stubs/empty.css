/*
 * File: empty.css
 * Description: Empty CSS stub used by the test environment.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Some components import CSS (e.g., DataGrid styles). In Vitest/jsdom runs, we map those
 *   imports to this file to avoid bundler/style-loader complexity.
 *
 * Contract under test:
 * - Must exist and be importable as a CSS module.
 * - Intentionally contains no rules.
 *
 * Out of scope:
 * - Any styling or layout.
