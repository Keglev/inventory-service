/**
 * @file DataGridThemeAugmentationStub.ts
 * @description Empty module stub for DataGrid theme augmentation side-effect imports.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Some MUI/X DataGrid packages ship TypeScript module augmentation files that are imported
 *   for side effects (types/theme augmentation). In tests, we may alias those imports to this
 *   stub to avoid bundling the full DataGrid theme augmentation.
 *
 * Contract under test:
 * - Must be a valid module that exports nothing.
 *
 * Out of scope:
 * - Any runtime behavior (this file is intentionally empty).
 * - Actual theme augmentation types.
